-- 20260515_dogs_prohibited_region_level_only.sql
--
-- BUG: promote_canonical_dogs_to_beach_dog_policy lifted ANY time_window
-- with rule="not_allowed" from zone_rules into dogs_prohibited_start/end
-- via the recursive `$.**.time_windows[*]` JSONPath. This conflated
-- SECTION-level time_windows (e.g., sand prohibited 9am-6pm) with
-- BEACH-WIDE prohibitions. Victoria Beach (8319) is the canary: sand
-- has a 9-18 not_allowed window; the rollup treated it as if dogs were
-- banned from the whole beach during those hours. Downstream effects:
--   - beach.html Hours card bold "Dogs not allowed 9-6" — wrong
--   - bar chart 9am-5pm bars rendered no_go red — wrong
--   - scoring engine sets hour_score=null for those hours — wrong
--   - Scout's apology blurb fires — wrong
--
-- FIX: restrict the JSONPath to REGION-level time_windows only:
--   v1 schema: $.regions[*].time_windows[*]
--   v2 schema: $.seasons[*].regions[*].time_windows[*]
-- Section-level time_windows (under regions[*].sections.*) no longer
-- bubble up into dogs_prohibited_start/end. The claimed_values fallbacks
-- (time_windows[0].before/after, time_prohibited_hours) are unchanged —
-- those come from LLM extraction of beach-wide prohibition prose.
--
-- Affected beaches (section-only bug, 3): Victoria Beach (8319),
-- Stump Beach (8739), Mission Beach (8356). All three will lose their
-- dogs_prohibited values after re-firing the promoter for them — which
-- is correct, since the prohibition is sand-specific, not beach-wide.
-- Legitimate region-level prohibitions (6 beaches in the "both" set)
-- continue to flow through.
